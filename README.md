# Barnacle Board
###### an RGB'd out breadboard you can stick things to

The Barnacle Board is a half-size breadboard with RGB LEDs under each row and a 70-pin card edge connector at the top.

This repo will contain all the various Barnacles I come up with. Feel free to submit a PR to add your own!

You can plug in (or stack multiple) Barnacles to do add new functionality to you breadboarding experience without cluttering the part your're working on.


The next few I'm working on are (in a vague chronological order):
 - Proto Barnacle - a cheap solderable protoboard that maps 1:1 to the breadboard ([done, shown here](https://kicanvas.org/?github=https://github.com/Architeuthis-Flux/Barnacle_Board/blob/main/ProtoBarnacle/ProtoBarnacle.kicad_pcb))
 - Sense Barnacle - a thing to continuously measure the voltage on every row and display it as a color/brightness on that row and on the built in OLED ([rough draft of the schematic is here](https://kicanvas.org/?github=https://github.com/Architeuthis-Flux/Barnacle_Board/blob/main/SenseBarnacle/SenseBarnacle.kicad_sch))
 - Dumb Barnacle - a very simple LED driver where row colors can be manually selected, and also a simple, selectable breadboard power supply
 - Internacle - a passive routing hub for multiple barnacles to pass connections between boards
 - SMD Barnacle - a bunch of SMD footprints, similar to the top part of a [Jumperlux](https://github.com/Architeuthis-Flux/JumperLUX) (this project is basically Jumperlux Rev 2 with a new name)
 - Professor Barnacle - wirelessly control the LEDs on any number (or subset of) of boards to help guide students through electronics labs
 - Nixie Barnacle - a nixie tube power supply and footprints to solder in various nixie tubes
 - Jumperless Barnacle - a [Jumperless](https://github.com/Architeuthis-Flux/Jumperless) with an edge connector instead of an integrated breadboard

If you think of any new ones that might be useful or if you disagree with the order I've put these in and think one should be prioritized, let me know!
