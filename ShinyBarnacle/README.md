# Shiny Barnacle


The Shiny Barnacle doesn't interact with the breadboard directly, but provides driver for the LEDs and a way to load/store different circuits from text files loaded into the RP2040's flash over USB, with some buttons and a knob for selecting and making nets. They can also include sequence information so a teacher can load a lab onto the students' boards and each step for building a circuit will be lit up as they build it.
